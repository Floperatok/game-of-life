# Game of Life


This is my basic personal implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C using X11.\
I'm using the MinilibX library from 42 school to make interacting with X11 easier. \
Cells are stored in bit arrays, using as less memory as possible.
Thoses bit arrays are separated in dynamically generated chunks, making the board practically infinite.

## Features
- X11 window
- Zoom with mouse scroll
- Camera mouvements with mouse right-click
- Cells editing with mouse left-click
- Step-by-step generation with the '**n**' key
- Maximum speed generation with the **spacebar**
- Load time telemetry


## Known Bugs
This project was more of a fun side project for me than a serious one, so bugs are present and I can't guarantee theyâ€™ll be fixed:
- Incorrect behavior when editing cells in negative chunks
- Chunks are generated but never deleted, causing the simulation to lag more and more over time
